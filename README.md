# Employee Polls

## Description
Employee Polls is a web app that lets an employee create polls for coworkers. An employee is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is not possible. \

Users can answer polls, see which polls they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post polls, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.
